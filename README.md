### Description  
In this project, we were tasked with creating a Note Taker application that allows the user to create new notes and delete existing notes.


After completing these initial tasks. I worked on hitting all the points outlined in the grading criteria.   

I made sure all the links functioned properly. As well as, included a link to the deployed applicaton on Heroku and a link to the GitHub repository. 

### Installation

There are no installation criteria for the user to successfully utilize the application.  

### Usage

To begin utilizing the application, the user simply needs to navigate to the deployed application on Heroku and start writing and deleting notes.
